How would you like it if you suddenly had to pay an extra $30 at the pump every time you filled up?  Or how about a $30 raise in your utility bill?  Nobody likes paying too much for something, especially when other people can get it for much cheaper.  But I'm not talking about gas prices or the hydro, no I'm talking about your Cell Phone and how you're being ripped off, and there's not much you can do about it.

<h2>"Fact"</h2>

Let me introduce you to the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association or CWTA for short.  The CWTA are a advocacy group fighting on behalf of the wireless communications industry in Canada.  To put it simply, they are a group that fights so Telus, Rogers, and Bell, can keep ripping you off.  Don't be fooled by their misleading "commitment to consumers", the only thing they care about is getting more money from your pocket.

[img src="http://blog.ianspence.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cwts.jpg"]Did you know? Fact: Wireless rates in Canada are typically lower than in the U.S., in some cases up to 40% lower and smartphone monthly plans are actually less expensive in Canada than in the United States[/img]

You'll be seeing this ad in newspapers for the next few months, and while its it partially true, it's incredibly misleading.  If you have ever consumed any form of news regarding Canadian Telecommunications you will have heard of the term "price gouging" and may have wondered what does that mean.  Price Gouging is the act of charging unfair amounts of money for a product due to lack of competition.  Just like the oil companies, Canadian Telecommunications are doing the same if compared to the US comms.

<h2>What about the little guys?</h2>

So what about the little guys like Wind, Moblicity and Public?  They offer very competitive rates that oftentimes match or beat the US carriers, but they lack the service coverage due to the Advance Wireless Service Auction.  They are very small fish in a vast ocean and sadly they will remain that way if nothing is done.  The carriers are in a catch-22 as they don't have a lot of customers due to lack of service, but they lack service because they have such few customers. At the time of writing, Public offers a $30/month plan that has unlimited Text, Talk, and Data on no fixed-term contract, however, Public only has service in Montreal and Ontario with other cities in the roaming zone.

<h2>Spectrum Management and Auction</h2>

Each carrier in Canada has it's own frequency of the Advance Wireless Service spectrum, and because there is a finite number of spectrums they are regulated and leased to buyers.  This helps prevent spectrums being squatted, however, it hinders small-time carriers from getting started due to the insane cost of buying these frequencies.  Below is a table showing the cost of purchasing a 10, 20, and 40MHz frequency license in every province and territory.

As on January 18th 2013, Moblicity has 600,000 subscribers, and was planned to be bought out by Telus, which had a $1.2 billion profit in 2011, however because Moblicity owns a different frequency than Telus, this would give them dominance over the spectrum and would violate the AWS Spectrum agreement.

<h2>Changes to the wireless codes</h2>

On December 2nd, 2013 new rules will be imposed by the CRTC in regards to the Wireless Codes of Conduct.  These changes will allow subscribers to:

<ul><li>Terminate their wireless contracts after two years without cancellation fees, even if they have signed on for a longer term.</li>
<li>Cap extra data charges at $50 a month and international data roaming charges at $100 a month to prevent bill shock.</li>
<li>Have their cellphones unlocked after 90 days, or immediately if they paid for the device in full.</li>
<li>Return their cellphones, within 15 days and specific usage limits, if they are unhappy with their service.</li>
<li>Accept or decline changes to the key terms of a fixed-term contract (i.e., two-year), and receive a contract that is easy to read and understand.</li></ul>

However the CRTC did not place any enforcement on price hikes due to the change in regulations, and it's extremely possible that the big three will raise their prices.  Because the change in rules don't apply to current customers, only new ones, the big three are pushing with promotional plans to get more customers locked into a three year contract.

<h2>What can be done?</h2>

As of right now, there isn't much you can do to help end the unfair price gouging.  If you live in a city consider switching to a smaller carrier like Wind, Mobility, or Public.  You'll save plenty and help get them out of their catch-22.  However, switching to a smaller carrier alone won't solve this problem, as I believe the federal government needs to make it's rules regarding price gouging much stricter, giving Canadians much more freedom when choosing a wireless carrier and phone plan.  What ways can you think of that will help?  Let me know in the comments.
