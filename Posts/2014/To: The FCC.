<p>The Internet is by far humanities greatest advancement.  Never before were people able to communicate, learn, play, and improve the lives of others in such magnitude.</p>
<p>But corporations are greedy and would like to take all of that away to secure some short-term profits.</p>
<p>Allowing a "fast-lane" Internet structure would completely destroy the Internet as we know it, effetely removing the one thing that has brought so many humans together to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of November, in 1936 the BBC began transmitting the world's first public television service in North London.  This is considered to be the birthplace of modern TV as we know it.  The television quickly became the norm for public opinion and shaped the culture we have today.</p>
<p>But now Television is a dying industry, as customers are upset over the amount of commercials, lack of programming, and channel restrictions.  Customers are canceling their TV service in favor of the much more open Internet. "Cord-cutting" as it's commonly referred to, is only increasing in popularity as more and more television providers fail to meet the expectations of their customers, causing them to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of the largest issues with Television service today is "bundles".  The idea that if you want one specific channel, you need to get a very expensive group of channels.  The consumers don't like this because they are spending more money, for channels they don't want all because they just wanted a single channel.</p>
<p>These, and many more problems created by the greed of television service providers will become problems that Internet users will face should the "fast-lane" structure be allowed.  The idea that you cannot go to Facebook, unless you have the "social media" bundle will effectively bring the end of the Internet, and the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>When you're dealing with one of the greatest advancements in technology, next to modern medicine and transportation, you never put corporation's profit margins ahead of people ability to access something that they should have the right to.</p>
<p>I, Ian Spence, urge you to schedule a series of large, open public hearings around the country to hear the concerns of the people about your net neutrality plan.  I urge you to protect an open Internet by building a solid legal argument for net neutrality using Title II of the Telecommunications act which would declare the Internet an essential service as a public utility. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.</p>
<p>Sincerely, <em>Ian Spence.</em></p>
