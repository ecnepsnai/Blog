It's that time of the year, again, Activision has released another Call of Duty, and we all buy it. No matter how much people hate on the franchise, they still buy it and still play it.  With Call of Duty, you know what you're going to get, and it's up to Activision to wow you.  So did Activision complete its goal and wow players with some next-gen graphics and a amazing story?  Read on to find out.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

The world is yet again under threat of attack by a rogue nation and you and you alone must stop it by killing everything in your sight.  You start the game off by sitting with your Brother and Father enjoying lunch when you feel the earth shake, a tremor you think, but then another, and then another, and you soon come to realize that its a lot worse.  Your Father mentioned something called Odin, and as you dodge falling debris all the way to your house you will come to realize what he was talking about.

The Gameplay of Call of Duty: Ghosts is just like the last 9 games in the series.  You are given a destination to go to, and have to fight your way there against an endless amount of enemies.  You get to your destination, watch a cutscene, and repeat.  It disappoints me that people may think that this is a good storytelling method, and that these games set the bar for having a gripping story.  One thing that Activision did change about Ghosts, was adding a survival game mode much like Zombies, but with Aliens.  However, I still feel that these game modes aren't fun and are just another gimmick to drive more sales of their DLCs.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

Did you actually expect a publisher to live up to its hype?  I'm almost offended at how underwhelming the graphics are in Call of Duty: Ghosts.  Activision <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fv__G6KJQ8" target="_blank">pushed videos</a> that showed their complete ignorance towards the current Graphic capabilities of modern systems by trying to market features like Dynamic Lighting, High Quality Textures, and Fluid Dynamics as if they have never been used in games that are much older than they are.  Clearly, Activision needs to look at what is current-gen before they start talking about next-gen.

The game runs at a solid 60-FPS with VSync enabled on my system (2x GTX 660).  A very odd thing I found about Call of Duty: Ghosts was that the load times for single player are extremely slow.  I'm used to being able to skip the loading video because my system loads the map before the video finished, but now I have to sit at a loading bar and watch a pushing ghost icon while I wait.  I never understood why Infinity Ward or Treyarch didn't work on some better loading technology.

<h2>Multiplayer</h2>

The multiplayer feature of Call of Duty: Ghosts is probably the only thing that keeps the franchise going, and yet it feels that if Infinity Ward has just let Multiplayer into the wild without some time to work on actually new game modes, rather than just revisions of current ones.  There are six "new" game modes, they are:

<h3>Search and Rescue</h3>
Much like Search and Destroy, this mode aims to encourage players to work together as each player is only given a single life per round, but can be revived if a teammate collectes their dropped dog tags.

<h3>Infected</h3>
<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/5/5052646/call-of-duty-ghosts-review" target="_blank">Polygon called Infected</a> "A shameless lift from the Halo franchise".  Players are tasked to pick off zombies one by one using shotguns.

<h3>Hunted</h3> 
Much like Counter Strike: Global Offensive's Arms Race but in reverse, players start with only a pistol and are presented with better guns as they appear around the map.

<h3>Grind</h3>
Like Kill Confirmed, players need to collect dog tags and deposit them at one of two drop off locations.  Again, this mode encourages teamwork and punishes those who play on their own.

<h3>Blitz</h3>
I never understood Blitz, nor did I find any real challenge to it.  Much like Capture the Flag, except without the flag, or the capturing, you just run into enemy territory, score a point, and be teleported back to your own base.

<h3>Cranked</h3>
An odd modification of Team Deathmatch rewards players with a 30-second performance boost after each kill, but explode if they do not make another kill within those 30 seconds.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

One thing that has become very clear about the Call of Duty series is that Activision aim to spend as little as money on the story and graphics as possible and put it all in marketing.  We all know the games are no different from the others, but we keep buying them.
