The Stanley Parable is one of those games that you will always remember.  It's neither exceptional, nor disastrous.  It's graphics aren't stunning, and the audio is average.  But, you just can't stop thinking about it.  The Stanley Parable is a game that features something that other lack: Choice.  Unlike most games where you just follow a pre-set story, the Stanley Parable gives you the ability to choose how you want the game to end.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

This is a story of a man named Stanley.  Stanley is employee number 427 and works in room 427 every day of every week of every year. Stanley works for a big business company in a big building. Stanley's job is to push buttons on his desk. Stanley receives orders on a monitor next to his desk telling him what buttons to press, how long to push them, and in which order. Though some people would dread to have this job, Stanley relished every second of it as if he had been made just for it.

<blockquote>But one day something quite peculiar happened...</blockquote>

The Stanley Parable plays like any other game.  You walk around, open doors, and push buttons.  There is no jumping, or sprinting.  No trading, shopping, DLCs.  Nothing.  Not even other players.  But these things would just take away from the plot(s).  All you're required to do is walk around and listen to the narrator.  But, it's much more than that.
<h2>Graphics</h2>

The Stanley Parable is built upon the Source Engine, an extremely reliable and non-demanding framework that has powered many games before.  The graphics are normal for a game of its caliber and age.
