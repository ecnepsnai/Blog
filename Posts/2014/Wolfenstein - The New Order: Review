Get ready to kick some Nazi ass with the all new instalment in the Wolfenstein series, "The New Order".  Machine Games, partnered with ID Development hope to bring you an epic fighting experience as you blast your way through a Nazi Occupied world.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

Wolfenstein starts you off with a stuttering cutscene about how you smell a barbecue, and how you picture American life if it weren't tainted by the Nazi regime.

However life is far from the pleasant sunday afternoon outings as instead you find yourself in an old bomber airplane heading towards your enemies base.  A friendly plane is shot down next to yours and you have to save the day by clamping the fuel intake to the engine.  After some other menial tasks, you get to enjoy another great stuttering cutscene that you can't skip.  Rushing the beach, you're given a show of the fascists technological strength as you and your comrades are being stalked by a large robotic cat.  After going for a brisk swim to a downed machine gun, help your comrades by killing said robotic cats.

With a real "call of duty" style, quickly after saving your comrades from almost certain doom you're right back in the line of fire saving their asses by taking out a machine gun nest.  As you go through these challenges, the game takes you through its controls and weapon systems, all of which seem to be pretty standard for FPS games. The game has a great mixture of choices when approaching a fight; letting you sneak your way in or run and gun them down, both of which make for a very fun experience.

Wolfenstein is singleplayer exclusive, which in an over saturated online FPS market is a real treat.  I typically don't play multiplayer games, and to see a game that focuses on players like me really shows that a game doesn't need any online gimmicks for it to be good.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

Wolfenstein makes use of the id Tech 5 engine, built in-house by ID Software.  This engine, introduced with RAGE, allows for extremely high quality textures to be used without extreme amounts of VRAM usage.  A clear sign of how this is accomplished is the on-the-fly compression/decompression of textures based off of your visual fidelity.  If you turn your head around very quickly in the game, you will see the textures decompress into high detail, and visa versa.  The downside to this is that Wolfenstein: The New Order is a whopping 40gb!

Wolfenstein: The New Order runs at about 30fps on ultra settings with the exception of cutscenes which run at either 60fps, or freeze entirely for multiple seconds.  Wolfenstein has plenty of graphic options to work with such as the shadow resolution which by turning it down will get you a bump in FPS.

<h3>The Cutscenes</h3>

The biggest turn off for me is that cutscenes run at about 1 frame-per-second or lower, sometimes freezing entirely for multiple seconds making the video practically impossible to watch.  Due to the game being so new, there isn't any fix at the time of writing this review so my advice is to wait a few weeks before jumping in so that Machine and ID can work on a fix to this issue.  If you've already gotten the game, try downloading the latest beta drivers for your graphics card and see if that will help.

<h2>Audio</h2>

The Audio in The New Order is slightly disappointing at first, but does get better as the game progresses.  Shortly after starting the game you find yourself on a beach you and your comrades just rushed.  There's fighting and death all around you, but all you hear are distant gunshots and your footsteps.  The lack of ambient audio, or even a score in a dramatic scene makes it hard to become immersed in the atmosphere.
