Grid 2 is the sequel to the massively popular racing game, Race Driver: Grid (Grid for short).  I personally loved Grid and had high expectations for Grid 2.

<h2>Right off the bat</h2>

Like Grid 1, you are thrown straight into a race without the opportunity to edit any settings, thankfully however, you can pause the game to make some minor changes.  The physics are much like all codemaster racing games, very loose.  However one thing stuck out that really bothered me: audio quality.  I'm not a huge audiophile, but when the engine of a muscle car sounds like it's coming from an iPad: somethings not right.  I took a look in the audio settings to find that the System EQ is set to "Flat" with the options of Flat, TV, and  Headphones.  Changing to TV didn't seem to change anything.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

The graphics of Grid 2 are as to be expected with Codemasters games: heavey.  My system (2x Nvidia GT660 OC) ran the game at ultra with VSync at a solid 60fps.  The texture quality of the game is decent, however some of the fonts appear to be raster, and are noticeably pixelated.

The game does, however, have an unnecessary amount of lens flare.  We're talking Battlefield 3 amount.  Every little thing causes a flare and it's just ugly.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

Unlike the original, GRID 2 takes more of a focus on building a fanbase rather than making money.  After each event you gain Fans, which will help you get noticed by more racing clubs.  There doesn't actually seem to be a financial system in the game at all, even though there is an achievement titled "Mo Money, No Problems".  A feature that I did really enjoy in GRID 1, sponsors, made a reappearance in the new game and have been improved.  In the original, sponsors would pay you if you met their conditions, which were usually just "Finish no lower than 3rd in the race".  However in GRID 2, sponsors now have more dynamic challenges that will require racers to actually work to meet the requirements.  Meeting the requirements will add more fans after each race.


<blockquote>Lack of customization makes for a dull and repetitive racing experience.</blockquote>

Comparing Grid 2 to Gran Turismo 5, you will see some major differences, the largest being a lack of tuning.  In GT5 you can completely tune the car however you want.  Changes that can actually determine a win or a loss.  Grid 2 lacks any kind of tuning or even upgrades to your car.  The only form of customization you can perform is a paint scheme, which has a really silly interface that doesn't let you choose any color - only presets.  This lack of customization made for a dull and repetitive racing experience.  You would pick the same car, race the same track, against the same people, and have the same outcome.

Surprisingly, GRID 2 looked a lot like it did in the screenshots.

One thing that did bother me was that the game ends and it is not very long.  It took me a few days to finish Grid 2, but when you finish the fifth season you see this montage about how you're the biggest racer in the world, but then it's over.  Credits roll and the entire career menu disappears.  While yes, Grid 1 ends as well, at least it took me around a month to actually reach the end.  When codemasters shuts down the multiplayer servers; this game will have a very short single-player with no other purpose.

<h2>Video Upload</h2>

Grid 2 has a video upload feature caked right into the replay system of the game, it is however, completely useless and very disappointing. So disappointing, that I am actually editing this post after my first reaction to make this change. 

To use the upload system is simple enough, connect your YouTube account with your RaceNet account and when in replay set a start and stop time then upload.  However you do have to between some stupid "categories" and "themes" for the video, which to my understanding do absolutely nothing.  However it's after the video has been uploaded is where the problems start.

As you can see in the video, it's only 480p.  At no point in time did I ever get a choice of how high quality I wanted this video to be.  And let's be honest, 480p looks like shit.  But I can forgive that, but Grid 2 takes advantage of unaware users by posting links to their websites in your video description, as well as a unholy amount of tags.  This system is a utter failure and makes me really disappointed.
