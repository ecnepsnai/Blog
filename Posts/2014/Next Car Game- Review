Bugbear Entertainment, a small Finnish gaming studio has come up with the next big leap in PC Racing games, and they're calling it: Next Car Game.  Next Car Game (or NCG for short) is a racing / demolition derby style game that features FlatOut like game play with sophisticated physics and damage models.  NCG is built upon the in-house engine ROMU which is specifically built for true-to-life physics so you get a lifelike experience when you drive your car into a flaming pileup.

[tip]<strong>Note</strong>: Next Car Game is an early access game available on PC only through Steam.  The game has bugs and is not complete.  If you don't like bugs: don't buy the game yet[/tip]

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

Demolition derby's, tarmac and dirt racing will bring out the inner 5-year-old inside of you that loves to see car crashes, flaming wrecks, and insane stunts.  And Bugbear has completely delivered not only these expectations, but much more.  You'll be smashing, crashing, and bashing your way through the pack to achieve first place, and whether first place is the first person to cross the finish line, or be the last man standing, you're going to take quite a beating along the way.

The game features a classic demolition derby where the only objective is to be the last man standing, by any means necessary, a race on a tarmac strip where you'll literally be fighting your way through the pack to get first place, and finally a race on a dirt strip where you'll be sliding into opponents and walls alike.  Many of the features in the game are currently disabled, however you can see that Bugbear is trying to make a FlatOut style game on modern systems.  Some of the features to come will be: Multiplayer, Car Upgrades, More Cars (currently you have a choice between a American Hot Rod and a European sedan), More Tracks, and More Carnage.

<h3>Physics</h3>

The game includes a free Tech Demo that showcases the exceptional ROMU engine with a fun playable area.  Take your car and drive it through a shredder, get hammered by an oversized mallet, make an automobile smoothie with a blender, and plenty more in the extremelly fun time waster.  You can play the tech demo for free by going to <a href="">Next Car Game's website</a>.

Currently, the physics is a bit too touchy as just moving about the course will cause your car to slowly become a mangled wreck, however this is an pre-release build so issues like this are likely to be resolved in later updates.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

Next Car Game runs surprisingly well on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIAJWnuh3xjfHPUjVDYtwycm4NcMs6VgdUgrMJW4HQU/edit?usp=sharing">my system</a>, which is incredible when you think about all of the calculations it has to perform with all of the damage models and physics.  The graphics are above average as compared to other racing games and runs at a smooth 50-60fps depending on what is going on in the game.

You can push the engine and your system to the limit to see how well it performs in the Tech Demo by experimenting with one of the physics tools such as the Black Hole or Missile on a large stack of barrels or boxes.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I have the highest hopes and expectations for Next Car Game and look forward to the full release.  The game has issues, but is a complete showcase for how damage models are to be done in games.  I would even dare to say that Next Car game sets the bar much higher and surpasses games with much bigger budgets.  The game is available on Steam with two versions, a Standard and a Deluxe edition.  The deluxe edition includes some features that aren't currently ready, but will be exclusive when released.
