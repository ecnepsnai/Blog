A feature that is lacking from OS X is the ability to disable the trash folder and have all items be removed entirely.  In this quick tip, I'll show you how to disable the trash folder.

<h2>Disable the Trash Folder</h2>

To disable the trash folder, all you have to do is open a terminal window and enter the following commands:

[sourcecode lang="bash"]cd
rm -rf .Trash
touch .Trash
chmod 000 .Trash[/sourcecode]

This accomplishes two things:

<ol>
<li>Deleted the trash folder for the current user.  <code>.Trash</code> is a hidden directory inside the home folder of the user.  That is where deleted files are kept.</li>
<li>Created a file called <code>.Trash</code> and prevent it from being modified.  This prevents finder from trying to re-enable trash</li>
</ol>

When you try to delete a file, you will now see this prompt.

If you don't want to see that prompt every time just press <code>Command + Option + Delete</code> rather than <code>Command + Delete</code>.  This will just delete the file with no fuss!

<h2>Enable the Trash Folder</h2>

To enable the trash folder, all you have to do is open a terminal window and enter the following commands:
