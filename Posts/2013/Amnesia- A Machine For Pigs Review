Possibly one of the most anticipated survival horror games of the year is Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.  With the new arrival of The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther, the second installment of the Amnesia is looking for be a good one.  Will it live up to those standards?

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

A Machine for Pigs starts out quite alike the first Amnesia, you're on the floor after experience some sort of flashback unaware of your location and even yourself.  You are located in this seemingly endless estate that appears to be nice, but has a much darker tone once you start exploring.  Bedrooms with cages around the beds, false mirrors and paintings in the bathrooms, and this ominous machine like sound coming from below.

<blockquote>"Sleep, my child, sleep
Your heart beats under my hand
And I cradle you
in these open wounds of mine"
â€“ Translated version of an in-game song
</blockquote>

You don't find out who your character is right away, unlike the first game.  All you know that your children are calling you, and you can't catch them.

However, a lot of the challenges found in The Dark Descent are missing from this game, for example, the oil in your lamp doesn't run out, and your sanity is no longer a factor.  These two things alone made the first game much harder to complete, so I'm not really missing their departure, however it did make the game a lot more intense.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

Certainly a step up from the first game, the graphics in a Machine for Pigs are not spectacular, but definitely add a huge amount of atmosphere to the game.

The game runs at or above 60Fps on High settings (maximum) with VSync on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIAJWnuh3xjfHPUjVDYtwycm4NcMs6VgdUgrMJW4HQU/edit?usp=sharing">my system</a>.  However, VSync does not appear to work or the setting is not honored as there is quite bad screen tearing on the top of my screen.

<h2>Audio</h2>

Atmosphere is critically important in games like these.  How else would I jump out of my chair screaming like a girl because a door slammed shut when I tried to open it?  The Sound Quality is perfect for a game of this calibre.  Machines coming to a grinding halt fill the open corridors triggering light fixtures to flicker and the player to panic are just some of the experiences Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs will put your through.
