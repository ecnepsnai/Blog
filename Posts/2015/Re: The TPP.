Dear The Honourable Chrystia Freeland,

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter of mine, I really appreciate the opportunity that I have to voice my opinions and thoughts on important issues in Canadian Government.

I am writing to you today about the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Like many others, I strongly oppose this proposed partnership, and fear the detrimental effects it would have on Canada, and the world if it's to be approved.

Canada has always been the government of the people, and while businesses are composed of people, their greed and lust for power often results in exploitation of honest, hard working citizens. After reading some of the key highlights of the bill it's clear to me that the TPP is an incredibly dangerous bill disguised as a peaceful trade agreement, and allowing Canada to adopt such a bill would be a massive betrayal of Canadians.

There are four main concerns that I have with the TPP that I will be writing about today: Health Care Access, Free and Open Source Software, Internet Censorship, and Copyright.

In times like these it’s become clear that corporate greed has no bounds, and corporate entities will never miss an opportunity to exploit consumers from their last penny. I’d like to use the following example of the outrageous price hike of a antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 (U.S.) a pill to $750<sup>[1]</sup>. I fear that price gouging of medicine, and many other goods, will become far too common for Canadians under the TPP. As world leaders, Canada must take a clear stance against corporate greed and price gouging and not let them sneak past this dangerous bill.

However, the wide-spread grasp of the TPP doesn’t cover only medicine, no it tries to cover every single area of trade in attempts to exploit people to boost gains. Another area I’d like to briefly talk about is something that is very important to me: Free & Open Source Software.

I work in the high-technology industry, and I spend a great deal of my time both at home and at work online. The internet truly is one of humanity's greatest advancements. One of, if not the most important components of the Internet is DNS. The Domain Name Service maps human-readable domain names like google.com to IP addresses, which computers use to communicate. The global DNS servers all operate using a free and open source program called BIND. BINDs success, and reliability is because it is free. Free and Open Source software isn't just free as in cost, it’s also free as it respects the freedoms and rights of its users. By requiring that the source code, being the raw code used to create the software, is freely available to view and use. Like BIND, many other software products are commonly licensed under the GNU General Public License, which is managed by the Free Software Foundation. One of the requirements of the GPL is that the TPP would eliminate many of the requirements set in place by the GPL and have a disastrous result for the FLOSS community and the advancement of technology<sup>[2]</sup>.

While the open source community may not seem like a priority for Canada, it’s benefits have been seen around the world and their passion is one of the biggest reasons the internet is as open, free, and successful as it is today. As influential leaders, Canada needs to make an example of how nations should be working to protect the open and free trade on information and ideas, not work to restrict or close it.

Quebec has recently passed laws to block gambling websites from their users, a dangerous and dirty practice used by oppressive states like China, Iran, and Turkey to control citizens. This must be stopped at the federal level from continuing as the TPP would require ISPs to block content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of copyright holders in the states.

While on the surface this seems like a decent enough idea, it often cascaded into a much larger problem. The United Kingdom voted to censor websites that feature pornographic content, making users who whish to access this content request their ISP to unblock it for their account. What they found was that while most of the major porn websites were successfully blocked, websites that had useful sexual education information were also blocked<sup>[3]</sup>. A bill that started out with honest and good intentions quickly became a demonstration to the world how bad internet censorship really is.

Blocking websites, while technically feasible, is a very expensive process that it can very easily be circumvented. There will always be a way for users to bypass filters, no matter how much money, time, and effort is put into it. In 2014, the Turkish government blocked access to Twitter to quell the civil unrest. The Turkish people made a clear example of the how useless web filters are by making a very simple change to their computers or smartphones network settings<sup>[4]</sup>.

Finally, we come to my final major concern with the TPP, however in no way would I consider this the least of my concerns. Copyright is a very sensitive issue, and any changes to the copyright law needs to be very carefully examined and scrutinized. The TPP would bring widespread changes to copyright law in Canada, bringing with it unfair changes that hurt the public domain.

Shakespeare has written many timeless classics. Plot elements from his work are still used today, and will most likely continue to be used for quite some time. Part of the reason for it's continued success, even after nearly 400 years since his death, is because copyright law allowed his work to enter the public domain. Much like free and open source software, public domain works benefit everybody as the tight grip of corporate control is forcefully released.

Changing the copyright term from life plus 50 years to life plus 70 years shows Canadians that the government is siding with corporate entities, prolonging works from entering the public domain and allowing corporate greed to exploit works to boost profits.

With a new federal government in majority power you have the opportunity to show Canadians which side you're fighting for: citizens, or corporate greed. Joining the TPP would bring about devastating problems to Canada, and the world. We cannot allow that. You, cannot allow the TPP to hurt Canadians.

<strong>Do not allow Canada to join the TPP.</strong>

Sincerely,

Ian Spence
