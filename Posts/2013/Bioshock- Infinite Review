Possibly one of the largest releases of 2013, Irrational Games takes players to new heights (literally) with the highly anticipated third installment in the Bioshock Series.  Expectations were high after the disappointment of Bioshock 2, and the announcement of the much desired departure of Rapture.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

Much like the previous two games, Bioshock Infinite takes place in the early 19 hundreds.  Starting off just like the first, you find yourself at a lighthouse with nowhere to go but inside.  After some exploring you're presented with a chair to sit in, that will take you to your destination.  However, unlike the first, Bioshock Infinite takes you up high in the sky, to "heaven, or as close as one can get".  The player, Booker, is posed with a task of finding this girl, Elizabeth, and bring her unharmed to New York.

Obviously, no game is perfect.  Even with the insane level of detail and gripping story there is one thing that made the game very awkward to play: Mouse Sensitivity.  For some reason, the sensitivity is extremely high, making combat very difficult and the player hard to control.  Even when you drop the setting to the lowest level, it still is considerably more sensitive than other games.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

The graphics are nothing short of amazing in Bioshock Infinite, but what is more amazing is the extreme level of detail.  Every nook and crannie in Columbia has been filled with something to look or interact with.  Houses look like homes with clutter, shops have specific advertisements and "time tables", and each and every character has a personality; rarely seeing two of the same.

The game runs at or above 60fps on Ultra without VSync on my system (2x ASUS GTX 660).

<h2>Audio</h2>

Audio is something that is often overlooked in games, being trumped by graphics or story, which can make or break a game.  However, Bioshock Infinite doesn't leave out this important element, and has exceeded my expectations.  Walking the streets of columbia you'll find that the citizens all have something to talk about, greeting you with polite gestures, discussing the latest news regarding the Vox Populi, lecturing kids, anything you would normally hear in a community.

The music in the game is another victory, everywhere from the loading screen to walking the streets you're scored by wonderfully composed music.  There's even a Quartet early in the game.
