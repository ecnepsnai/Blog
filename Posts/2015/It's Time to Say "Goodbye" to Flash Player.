Two years ago I wrote on how to disable Java from your web browser.  Now, it's time to say "Goodbye" to Adobe Flash Player, for good.  In the past week alone, multiple critical security vulnerability have been discovered that put you at risk, even if you keep flash up-to-date or use Google Chrome.

<h2>But what if I need Flash Player?</h2>

If you absolutely NEED the Flash Player for a website I would recommend you download and install a secondary browser and enable it on that, and only use that browser for that specific task.  For example, if you use Google Chrome as your primary browser: download and install Firefox and enable Flash in it so you can use that one website.
