<p>It appears Yahoo is already breaking it's new toy, and has blocked a bunch of tags from being searched in Tumblr. &nbsp;Some of these tags, are a core part of the Tumblr community, and will surprise you.</p>

</ul>
<p>Tumblr has a community of people who are very involved in LGBTQ Based Hate, Depression, and Social Anxiety, a lot of people that are suffering from these problems turn to Tumblr for help, by blocking tags like "gay", and "depression", but allowing "self-harm" you are in theory putting a lot of kids at risk, even though you have a <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/counseling_prevention_resources" target="_blank">support page</a> that gives out resources for said people.  Yahoo, don't fuck this up.</p>
