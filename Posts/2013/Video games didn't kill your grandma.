<p>On August 26th, An 8-Year-Old boy is believed to have shot and killed his 90 year old Grandma after playing Grand Theft Auto IV.  Clearly, this is the fault of the video game because you kill people in it.  Right? No.  I find it absolutely ridiculous that people blame video games for the actions of their children.  If you only feed your child McDonalds, is it their fault when your kid become overweight and unhealthy?  No, because you brought them there.  If your child is texting while driving and get into an accident, is it the phones fault?  No.  Then how is it the fault of Rockstar Games for this child actions?

Coming from a very rich highschool I see it all the time, parents that are completely ignorant about their children that would rather blame somebody else for their actions because <em>"my little pumpkin would never do that"</em>.

<h2>Guns</h2>

My dad was hunter, same with his dad, and probably his dad.  I grew up with guns.  However, outside of the virtual world of video games, I've never killed anything using a gun.  But things are very different in the USA, guns can be purchased at your local Wal-Mart with little-to-no restrictions other than a id.  I've read article after article on major news sites stressing how it's GTAs fault that this 90 year old died, but none that mentioned the fact that this child was able to get his hands on a loaded weapon, let alone why a 8 year old is playing a game rater for teens a decade older than him.

<blockquote>Outside of the virtual world of video games, I've never killed anything using a gun.</blockquote>

My dad was smart, he kept his guns locked inside a cabinet within a locked room.  I never knew where the key is, and still to this day don't.  I never had the need nor desire to go in there and get a gun and kill something because I played games for my age group when I was a kid.

<h2>"They make you violent"</h2>

A widely assumed fact is that violent video games make you violent.  And that is true; if you're mind isn't mature enough to understand the difference between the virtual world and the real one.  I was introduced to video games when I was young, the first game I can remember that involved killing was Outlaws, released in 1997.  You play a US Marshall and come home to find your wife dying, and your daughter kidnapped.  Shoot your way through the spaghetti western themed levels to get your daughter back, and extract revenge for the death of your wife.

My parents were very controlling of which games I played, completely banning me from Grand Theft Auto until I was in my teenage years, and using the ESRB rating system to judge which games they would purchase me.  I remember being in EB Games (GameStop in USA) and my mom asking if I've played GTA before and her not negatively reacting when I said yes.  I am in no way a violent person, however I've played my fair share of violent games, this goes against everything that these parents are trying to say, why?  Because video games are violent because people are violent, not the other way around.  Think about it this way, the first video game was patented in 1947, but humans have been violent long before that.  Letting a normal 18 year old play GTA will not cause him to go out and shoot his grandmother unless there are other factors, however letting a 8 year old may, because in that decade of growing you learn that there are consequences to your actions in life, and you can't do the things you can in GTA.

<h2>What about ESRB, PEGI?</h2>

If you are to wander out to your local game store, or any store that sells games, and you will see them everywhere.  In North America games are stamped with E's, M's, and T's and in Europe games are stamped with Ages.  Much like movies, games have ratings to help parents judge which games they should buy for their kids.  Working at an electronics store I see it all the time, parents completely ignoring the warnings on the front and back of the games that are written in plain text and putting their kids, and themselves at risk.  They even have the nerve to get angry at me when I remind them of these warnings and tell them that the game may not be appropriate for children, telling me not to tell them how to raise their kids.

"But what if their friend brings a game over!" well you're covered there also.  Every console on the market has parental controls.  You can restrict which games the system will play and secure these settings with a passcode.

Your child isn't going to restrict which games they will play, it's your job to do that as a parent.  Obviously you can't sit there every second watching them, so let the console do the work for you.  Refer to your consoles owner manual for instructions on how to set up parental controls, or simply Google it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

To sum things up, I'm blaming the parents for full responsibility of what their child did by giving him access to guns, letting him play a adult targeted game, and not using the tools developed for their benefit.  Video Games didn't kill your grandma, your bad parenting did.
