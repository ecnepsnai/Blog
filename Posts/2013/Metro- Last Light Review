Metro: Last Light.  The much anticipated sequel to (now defunct) THQs hit: Metro: 2033.  This game takes place in a post apocalyptic Moscow in the year 2034.  The world has been obliterated by nuclear war and humanity has taken refuge in the metro tunnels under the city, however, old habits never die and the kindles of war are starting to flare between the Russian Loyalists, Nazis, and the Rangers.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

Differing from the first Metro (2033), Last Light is less of a horror game and more of a psychological thriller with First-Person-Shooter Aspects.  The game takes place 1 year after you and your fellow Rangers find D6, the hidden Underground bunker that will lead you on your path to launching a missile strike on the Botanical Gardens, home to the feared "Dark Ones".  Kahn wakes you from a nightmare to tell you that he spotted a living dark one, and that you must get to it to try and communicate with it.  This starts you on your path to find out whether the dark ones are friend or foe.

Last Light at a lot of times was frustratingly difficult, as wave after wave of enemy come at you and you only have 30 seconds left on your last air filter.  It's very easy to get stuck in a loop if you run out of filters, and your last save point was just before you die.  This happened once while I was playing Metro: 2033, and resulted with me having to use a trainer to just get out of the loop.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

The graphics in Last Light are exceptional in a lot of ways, but fall short in others.  The graphics in the outdoors area are nothing less than spectacular, with wonderful texture quality and particle effects.  However, underground you can be greeted by low-quality textures and incorrectly layered effects.

When you're outside, the weather is always rapidly changing.  Making the game much more difficult as you search for your waypoint in a freak rainstorm.  The game runs at 60fps with dips to 40 on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIAJWnuh3xjfHPUjVDYtwycm4NcMs6VgdUgrMJW4HQU/edit?usp=sharing">my system</a>.
