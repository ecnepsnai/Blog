Java has quickly become one of the least secure application frameworks on the internet.  Regardless of how much or strong your antivirus is, a nasty Java exploit can ruin your system and spread to other computers on a network.  Very, <em>very</em>, few websites still use Java, so you can safely disable it without having problems.

<h2>But what if I need Java?</h2>

If you absolutely NEED Java for a website I would recommend you download and install a secondary browser and enable Java in that, and only use that browser for that specific task.  For example, if you use Google Chrome as your primary browser: download and install Firefox and enable Java in it so you can use that one website.
