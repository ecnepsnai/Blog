Tumblr is an awesome community and I am in a true love/hate relationship with it right now.  I love the community, but hate the platform.  Now that Yahoo owns Tumblr, I would love to see these changes made:

<ol>
<li><strong>Spam or fake accounts. &nbsp;</strong>This includes: spam accounts, account squatting, and impersonating accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking System. &nbsp;</strong>Tumblr lacks an essential part of a social network: blocking users. &nbsp;Tumblr currently only lets you "ignore" users but never actually block them. &nbsp;Tumblr should allow users to block other users from even accessing their blogs and especially submitting questions/posts.</li>
<li><strong>API.&nbsp;</strong>Tumblr's API is a mess. &nbsp;Relying on HTML for post messages is not a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Features.</strong> &nbsp;Tumblr needs to add more batch operations to their site. &nbsp;An example being: Allowing users to delete multiple posts at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming API (Push Notifications). &nbsp;</strong>Tumblr currently does have a minor streaming API, however they do not allow for public access, not even in their own apps. &nbsp;A streaming API allows applications to have new posts pushed to the application without it having to request for it. &nbsp;This also allows for Push Notifications on Mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Changing the post Source. &nbsp;</strong>I really hate how you can change the source of an image when reblogging. &nbsp;Tumblr should remove this feature and make it so that the source of an image can only be set once.</li>
<li><strong>Lists. &nbsp;</strong>All major social networks (Twitter, Facebook and Google+) allow you to sort users into lists to see only their posts. &nbsp;This could be very useful on Tumblr as it could work just like tags but only showing users you follow.</li>
<li><strong>NSFW per Post not per Blog. &nbsp;</strong>I don't quite know what the NSFW option does to your blog, but I do know that having an option to set an individual post as NSFW, which could place a censor over the image that would disappear on hover would be a much better solution.</li>
<li><strong>Better account security. &nbsp;</strong>Tumblr security isn't a huge issue right now, but it would be beneficial to them to beef it up before anything happens. &nbsp;2-Factor authentication is always a good start.</li>
<li><strong>Group Blogs. &nbsp;</strong><span>Add features like user roles and more business options. &nbsp;There are even a lot of&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;for Tumblr to profit in this area.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>These are just a few of the improvements that I really would love to see Tumblr make. &nbsp;What do you think? &nbsp;Is there anything you would add to this list?</span></p>
