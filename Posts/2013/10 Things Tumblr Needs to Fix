Tumblr is an awesome community and I am in a true love/hate relationship with it right now.  I love the community, but hate the platform.  Now that Yahoo owns Tumblr, I would love to see these changes made:

<ol>
<li><strong>Spam or fake accounts. </strong>This includes: spam accounts, account squatting, and impersonating accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking System. </strong>Tumblr lacks an essential part of a social network: blocking users. Tumblr currently only lets you "ignore" users but never actually block them. Tumblr should allow users to block other users from even accessing their blogs and especially submitting questions/posts.</li>
<li><strong>API.</strong>Tumblr's API is a mess. Relying on HTML for post messages is not a good idea.</li>
<li><strong><s>Batch Features.</s> (Added!)</strong> Tumblr needs to add more batch operations to their site. An example being: Allowing users to delete multiple posts at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><s>Streaming API (Push Notifications).</s> (Added!)</strong> Tumblr currently does have a minor streaming API, however they do not allow for public access, not even in their own apps. A streaming API allows applications to have new posts pushed to the application without it having to request for it. This also allows for Push Notifications on Mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Changing the post Source. </strong>I really hate how you can change the source of an image when reblogging. Tumblr should remove this feature and make it so that the source of an image can only be set once.</li>
<li><strong>Lists. </strong>All major social networks (Twitter, Facebook and Google+) allow you to sort users into lists to see only their posts. This could be very useful on Tumblr as it could work just like tags but only showing users you follow.</li>
<li><strong>NSFW per Post not per Blog.</strong>I don't quite know what the NSFW option does to your blog, but I do know that having an option to set an individual post as NSFW, which could place a censor over the image that would disappear on hover would be a much better solution.</li>
<li><strong><s>Better account security.</s> (Added!)</strong> Tumblr security isn't a huge issue right now, but it would be beneficial to them to beef it up before anything happens. 2-Factor authentication is always a good start.</li>
<li><strong>Group Blogs. </strong><span>Add features like user roles and more business options. There are even a lot of opportunities for Tumblr to profit in this area.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>These are just a few of the improvements that I really would love to see Tumblr make. What do you think? Is there anything you would add to this list?</span></p>
