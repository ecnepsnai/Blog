One doesn't simply take a game like Saints Row seriously, and Volition clearly doesn't want that with the 4th installment in the incredibly obscene, rude, gross, and all-around awesome series.  After the loss of THQ, I became nervous about the game's future, fearing that it would lose it's edge and become more tame.  However quite the opposite happened, with plenty of vulgar and obscene advertisements and even other-the-top editions of the game like the "Super Dangerous Wad Wad" for $1,000,000 USD that'll take you to space and give you hostage training.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

There are a lot of elements in Saints Row IV that are apparent in Saints Row III.  However, the few changes that have been made, do make a big difference.  One of the biggest changes is the 'Upgrades' section, to put it simply, your character now has super powers and can do things that normally wouldn't have been possible without the use of cheat codes. Much like the other games, you start off not knowing your characters Gender by not seeing it's facial features or hearing it's voice. The game takes place after the events of the last game, where you take down S.T.A.G. in Steelport, where the leader of the Anti-Gang Unit has gone mad with power.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

The graphics in Saints Row IV are certainly not the best, but far from the worst.  The game does, however, lack a lot of fine-detail, giving it a sometimes amature feel.  Artifacts can be seen around characters heads, hills have no brush or trees on them, effects can improperly overlay objects, you get the idea.  None of these issues are game-breaking, just minor things that caught my eye.

My system, 2x ASUS GTX660 can run the game never falling below 60fps with VSync on the Ultra settings.

<h2>Audio</h2>

Saints Row IV has, sadly, surprisingly awkward voice-acting.  Especially amongst the older Characters like Cyrus, using completely different sounding actors with no regard for players who have recently played the earlier games.

However, something I did love from Saints Row III, was the great music.  Right away you're greeted with everybodys <em>Favourite</em> song, I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing by Aerosmith.  The game features music from dubstep to rock, creating a fun and diverse experience.

<h2>Character Customization</h2>

One thing that Saints Row IV has that so far, no other game in the same genre has matched; is Character Customization.  You control everything from the pitch of the voice, to the size of the bulge in your pants (if you've selected male as your sex).
