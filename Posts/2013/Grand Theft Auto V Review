It's finally arrived, the most anticipated game of 2013 has come out after years of speculation and rumours.  Grand Theft Auto V.  Rockstar Games is one of the most criticised and accredited publishers ever, holding one of the very few AO (Adult Only) games published, Manhunt 2, and The Most Successful Game Ever, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which has sold over 25 million copies and still continues to sell to this day.  The series of organised crime and controversy continues from the last game, Grand Theft Auto IV, which has also sold around 25 million copies according to GameInformer, and leaves very large shoes to fill.  However, I have no doubt that Rockstar will be able to pull it off, and make history once again with the series that so many hate, yet continues to dominate the gaming scene.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

When you have a series of games like Grand Theft Auto, taking risks can be either lead you with huge success or huge failure.  And it's obviously clear that Rockstar has landed themselves with a huge success by taking a big risk, and completely deviating from one of the main core constructs of the series that's been a part since the first release: one playable character.  In Grand Theft Auto V, you don't just control one character, but three (and sometimes even a dog!).  Three playable characters, all with their own personalities, special abilities, missions, homes, cars, everything.  Essentially it's three Grand Theft Auto games all packed into one extremely large map.

The game starts with a prologue featuring one of the three characters you're able to play later in the story, Michael.  Like the last GTA release; Episodes of Gay Tony, you start off in a Bank Robbery, although this time you're on the other end, as the people robbing the bank.  Blow up the vault and grab the cash.  However we all know nothing goes to plan, and you're quickly faced with waves of policemen trying to stop you.  This is where the game introduces you to the multiple character aspect of the game, requiring you to change characters to help guide your way to freedom, or so you plan.

<h3>Customization</h3>

You can almost hear the fan boys squealing, Car customization has returned, and it brought a <em>little friend</em> with it too, Weapon Customization.  One of the biggest complaints from Grand Theft Auto IV was the lack of Car Customization that was so popular and widely used in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

<h3>Heists</h3>

Another new feature to the gameplay is Heists.  The player is introduced to the concept of performing a heist in the main story, tasking them to scout out the security features and possible entry points to a Jewelry store.  The player then gets to chose how they want it all to go down with either a "loud" or "stealthy" entrance.  Giving the player far more choice in the gameplay and the story than what was had in Grand Theft Auto IV.  And with the upcoming release of GTA Online, players can perform heists with Friends online.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

Disappointing is sadly the only word I can think of to describe the quality of graphics in the game.  However, having a powerful gaming computer can cause one to forget that the console games don't always look as good as the ones from Steam.  The graphics on Grand Theft Auto V are in 720p output, which is great for people who sit at a distance.  But if you're like me, who have to sit up close, you start to see the pixels, and the blurriness, and you quickly remember how good 1080p looks.

Understandably, with a map this large, Rockstar had to cut the graphics quality to not compromise on playable area size.  Being that this is a PS3, there were no performance issues as the game is tuned to the system.
